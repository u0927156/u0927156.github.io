								<h1><strong>Gimme, Gimme, Gimme</strong> (An Analysis of ABBA)</h1>
							</header>
                            
                            <h1>Introduction</h1>
							<p>A lot of people have asked me, how would you rate all 112 ABBA songs? I eventually got tired
                                of the question, so I decided to answer everyone all at once. Over the course of a few weeks,
                                I listened to all 112 ABBA songs, as defined by the wikipedia page "List of songs Recorded 
                                by ABBA" and rated each of them on a tierlist-inspired scale of E, D, C, B, A, and S with S
                                being the highest and E being the lowest. Additionally, I recorded the number of Spotify plays
                                of each song at the time I listened to them. I then did some digging into the data I created. 
                                So without further ado, let's get started
							</p>

					<h2>Rating Breakdown</h2>
				
					<iframe src="ScoreBreakdown.html" width="1000" height="600"></iframe>
	
					<p>As you can see I generally think ABBA is pretty good. The average score was 2.93, corresponds
						to just below an A. A was also the most common score with 34 of the 112 songs. There was only
						one song I gave an E, but I think it deserves it.
					</p>

					<h2>Average Score and Total Plays by Year</h2>

					<iframe src="mean_score.html" width="1000" height="600"></iframe>

					

					<p>
						This isn't incredibly surprising, but it looks like ABBA was at it's best 
						in the late seventiees and early eighties. Additionally, their return album in
						2021 was pretty good score wise, but not nearly as popular as their early songs.
					</p>

					
					<p>
						Their best year according to score was 1978. However, that was only a single song that 
						I happened to like, so it's not the best conclusion to draw.  
					</p>



					<h2>Popularity</h2>

					<p>
						I was curious to see how my tastes aligned with the broader public's. To do this I 
						plotted my scores vs spotify plays. 
					</p>

					<iframe src="score_vs_popularity.html" width="1000" height="600"></iframe>


					<p>
						This didn't reveal any relationship to me, so I decided to plot my scores 
						vs the log10 popularity of each song. Basically, we're going to be looking at 
						how many zeros are in the number rather than the actual number itself.
					</p>

					<iframe src="score_vs_log_popularity.html" width="1000" height="600"></iframe>

					<p>
						No things are a little clearer. It seems like their is a relationship between
						the number of zeros in the spotify plays and how high I rated the song. This make
						sense, the better the song is, the more people will want to listen to it. 
					</p>

					<p>
						My next question was, where did I and the public, as defined by spotify plays, most 
						disagree. To do this I performed a linear regression, a technique that tries to find a 
						simple line that describes the data as best as possible. I then found how far each of
						the songs was away from this line. If a song was above this line, I called it underrated,
						because I thought it was better than the number of listens it had idicated. If it was 
						below the line, I called it overrated, because it was played more times than it should be.
						The result of this is the following plot.
					</p>

					<iframe src="ratedness.html" width="1000" height="600"></iframe>

					<p>
						The purple line is what was recovered. Interesting the line's slope is almost one 
						to one between the score and the number of 0's in the spotify plays. A song with 10,000 listens
						would theoretically be 0. And a score with 1,000,000,000 listens would be a 5. The exact formula
						for the line is:
					</p>

					<h5>
						Score = 1.01 * log(popularity) - 4.15
					</h5>

					<p>
						The most overrated song was "When I Kissed the Teacher," which I did not like at all. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The most underrated
						song was "The Day Before You Came," which I had never heard of before but liked a lot for it's 
						strong imagery. 
					</p>
