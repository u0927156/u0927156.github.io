						<h1>Using Clustering and a Neural Network to Classify Beans</h1>
					</header>

					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						Let's talk about beans.
					</p>

					<img src="/images/beans.png" style="margin:2em">

					<p>
						That's right Gob, beans. They're the little hard things that people
						boil until they're soft and then eat. They're full of protein and they
						taste pretty good. You can boil them, mash and refry them, and even
						stick them in a soup. They're pretty versatile. But how do you tell what
						type of bean is what? Some researchers, Murat Koklu and Ilker Ali Ozkan,
						wanted to teach computers how to tell apart different kind of beans. They
						made a computer vision system which can tell us 16 things about beans. This
						information includes things like area, the length of the bean, the roundness,
						and an additional four quantified descriptors called shape factors. There are
						seven different types of beans that we are trying to distinguish. But this
						task isn't necessarily simple. Let's look at some plots to see why.
					</p>

					<p>
						Looking at this graph, we have a lot of overlap in our beans. The bombay beans
						are further out, but the rest tend to cluster together pretty closely. This means
						that any technique we apply will have difficulty separating these beans from each
						other. But thankfully, we have 14 more dimensions we can look at. Unfortunately,
						our monitors have difficulty showing even four dimensional images. We can mitigate
						this problem using something called Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
					</p>

					<h3>Principal Component Analysis</h3>

					<p>
						Principal component analysis is a technique that we can use to reduce the number of
						important dimensions in our data. The technique works by finding a combination of
						dimensions that vary the most. For example, if the area and the length of the bean
						varied much more than the other variables, we might get a principal component that is
						nearly a one-to-one combination of those two variables. This means that instead of
						having two big variables, we can explain that change with only one variable which is a
						combination of those two. This a very simplistic explanation of PCA. For a more thorough
						explanation check out this YouTube video
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgakZw6K1QQ">
							here
						</a>
					</p>

					<p>
						The upside of all that is that we can perform PCA on our bean data to get two variables
						which explains the most about the variance in our data and is easy to plot. So here's
						what we get:
					</p>

					<iframe src="/Figures/pca2d.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe>

					<p>
						We can see the beans are still pretty clustered. The Bombay beans are off doing their own
						thing but the rest are pretty tightly clumped. This means that two principal components
						are not enough to separate our data. So what if we try three?
					</p>

					<iframe src="/Figures/pca3d.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe>

					<p>
						If you look around, you can see that they're still clustered, but that they seem to have sort
						of their own regions in 3D space. This is good news, because it will mean that we can
						separate our data and we should be able to classify them. So let's try some classification.
					</p>

					<h2>
						k-means Clustering
					</h2>

					<p>
						<i>k</i>-means clustering is a process where we try to breakup our data into k clusters.
						This is an unsupervised learning algorithm, which means we don't tell it the labels we're
						trying to predict, we just see what it can uncover on its own. So, after finding the clusters
						we will project back into PCA space so that we can see the results. So without further ado,
						here are our clusters in two and three dimensions:
					</p>

					<iframe src="/Figures/pca3d_with_centers.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe>

					<p>
						It looks like this algorithm is having some difficulty with this data. It thinks that the
						Bombay cluster is actually two separate clusters. It makes sense since that cluster is
						so much larger than the others, but it isn't very help for classification. In three
						dimensions it looks a little bit better if you click on the legend to only look at
						certain types of beans at once. So it might work, but in three dimensions we don't have
						enough information to accurately classify these beans. So let's trying something more
						advanced.
					</p>

					<h2>Neural Networks</h2>

					<p>
						That's right, we're going to use a neural network to classify beans. It's not much
						but it's honest work. Just a quick word, neural networks, work by having lots of little
						nodes, these nodes receive an input, which is weighted, and then transformed into an output.
						The simplest version of this might just be to add together all of the input and pass that on.
						We use lots of these nodes to to form a network with multiple layers. And if we have enough
						of these nodes we can learn most functions. How do we learn you ask? We train the network. We
						make lots of predictions and then see how wrong we are. We then change the weights in the node
						so that we're a little bit more right. If we do this for long enough, the network learns
						what it's representing and can make accurate predictions.
					</p>

					<p>
						If you're wondering about the technical details, here they are. I used tensorflow and keras
						to create a neural network with 16 inputs. I used three dense hidden layers with 128 nodes each.
						The first layer used relu for its activation function and the last two used a sigmoid
						activation function. Finally, the output layer was another layer with seven outputs which
						was transformed into a probability of each bean using softmax. I used categorical crossentropy
						for the loss function, and the adam optimizer for training. I trained each model for 20 epochs
						and had withheld 1/4 of the data for testing.
					</p>

					<h2>Training Results</h2>

					<p>
						The first model I trained, after normalizing the data, only had an accuracy of 63% which is
						fairly low. Looking at the classification report, the model was able to classify some beans
						with 100% accuracy, while for one it was as low as 24%. So there's a lot of room to improve
						since the the original researchers were able to get accuracy as 93%.
					</p>

					<p>
						So what did I do next? Well, all that talk about principal component analysis is going to come
						back now. PCA can be used to reduce the dimensionality of your dataset, but it can also be used
						to preprocess it so that your machine learning algorithms can work a little better. So instead
						of
						training my next network on the raw data I performed PCA and whitening. What is whitening? If
						you
						remember how I said that PCA finds combinations of variables that explain the most variance in
						the
						data. We can create the same number of these combinations as original variables. So we're going
						to make 16 of these principal components. We can take these combinations and normalize them so
						they're all the same size. This means that they all have the same variance. Intuitively, this
						means that smaller difference are now just as important as large differences. And since we're
						trying to classify these beans which are very closely related, these small difference may be
						very important.
					</p>

					<p>
						So how well did whitening work? The network was able to achieve 96% accuracy. This is three
						points higher than they were able to in their original paper. We can check out the whitened
						versions of the PCA beans in the figures below to see why this works a little.

					<p>
						They look very similar to what we have above. But if you look at the axes, you can see
						that they are much smaller. Instead of going to several thousand, they only go from -1 to 7.
						This makes it much easier for the neural network to train on this data and also helps separate
						the clouds in higher dimensions.
					</p>

					<h2>
						Conclusion
					</h2>

					<p>
						My neural network was able to achieve an accuracy of 96%. This is slightly higher than what was
						previously reported in the paper. I was able to achieve this result using PCA and whitening to
						preprocess the data. K-mean clustering was not able to very reliably cluster these beans by
						type.
