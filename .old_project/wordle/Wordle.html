						<h1><strong>A Wordle Solver</strong></h1>
					</header>

					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						I probably don't need to tell you what Wordle is, but I will anyways. Wordle is a
						daily word game where you have six tries to guess an unknown five letter word. When
						you make a guess, each letter's tile will turn one of three colors, where each color has
						its own meaning. If a letter is highlighted in grey, it means it is not in the word.
						If it turns yellow, it means it is in the word, but not at the spot, and if its green it
						is in the word and in the correct position. If you haven't tried it yet, it's pretty fun
						and this will make more sense. So here's a link: <a
							href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a>
					</p>

					<p>
						Now that you've tried it, we can move on to what I've been doing. I was talking to
						my family one night, and they said making a solver would be easy. I insisted that
						it would be a lot harder than they thought. But when they left, I went ahead and gave
						it a shot, and it actually wasn't that hard. So they were right. Thanks for the idea too!
					</p>

					<p>
						So here I will explain how my solver works and share some of the insights into the game that
						I've gathered from running a few thousand simulations with it. So without any further preamble,
						let's begin.
					</p>

					<h2>
						The Solver
					</h2>

					<p>
						The solver works by eliminating words that don't match what it knows is true, and then finding
						a new guess by scoring each of the possible remaining words and choosing one, and then repeating
						this process until it arrives at the right answer.
					</p>

					<h3>
						Eliminating Wrong Answers
					</h3>

					<p>
						There are four steps that my solver uses to eliminate all words that can't be the answer.


					<ol>

						<li><strong>Removing words that aren't in the solution</strong></li>
						For example, if we have a grey T, we remove all words that have T's in them.

						<li><strong>Only keeping the words with letters that must be in the solution</strong></li>
						For example, if we have a yellow or green letter, we ignore all words that don't have those
						letters in them.

						<li><strong>Remove words that don't have letters in the right place.</strong></li>
						For example, if a word ends in G and is yellow, we remove all words that also have G in that
						same
						position.

						<li><strong>Removing words with letters in the same position as yellow tiles</strong></li>
						For example, if we have a yellow A in the first spot, we remove all words that have A in that
						first spot as
						well.
						This way we will always learn something new.

					</ol>

					</p>

			<p>
				If all of that was Wordle salad to you, don't worry. We're going to go through an example.
				Let's say the solution is:
			</p>

			<div class="wordle-grid">
				<div class="wordle-row">
					<div class="green cell">M</div>
					<div class="green cell">A</div>
					<div class="green cell">P</div>
					<div class="green cell">L</div>
					<div class="green cell">E</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>
				Of course, we don't know that at the beginning. Let's use my typical starting word,
				irate to start out with. We would get this:
			</p>

			<div class="wordle-grid">
				<div class="wordle-row">
					<div class="gray cell">I</div>
					<div class="gray cell">R</div>
					<div class="yellow cell">A</div>
					<div class="gray cell">T</div>
					<div class="green cell">E</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>
				Right now, before any analysis, we have 12947 words to choose from. It's pretty unlikely to
				make a good guess now. You would only have a 0.00077 percent chance of guessing correctly.
				So let's start by filtering out some of those words. The first thing we do
				is get rid of words that contain letters that were in gray. So words like
			</p>


			<div class="wordle-grid">
				<div class="wordle-row">
					<div class="wrong gray cell">R</div>
					<div class="yellow cell">E</div>
					<div class="yellow cell">A</div>
					<div class="gray cell">D</div>
					<div class="gray cell">S</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="wordle-grid">
				<div class="wordle-row">
					<div class="wrong gray cell">T</div>
					<div class="wrong gray cell">R</div>
					<div class="yellow cell">A</div>
					<div class="wrong gray cell">I</div>
					<div class="gray cell">N</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="wordle-grid">
				<div class="wordle-row">
					<div class="wrong gray cell">I</div>
					<div class="gray cell">N</div>
					<div class="wrong gray cell">T</div>
					<div class="yellow cell">E</div>
					<div class="wrong gray cell">R</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>
				are now going to be removed because they all contain letters that we know
				are not in the correct solution. After removing these words we are left with 6429 words.
				We now have a 0.012 percent chance of guessing. Which is a lot better, but still very bad.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, let's focus on getting rid of words that don't have A and E. We would remove words like
			</p>

			<div class="wordle-grid">
				<div class="wordle-row">
					<div class="gray cell">B</div>
					<div class="gray cell">O</div>
					<div class="gray cell">U</div>
					<div class="gray cell">N</div>
					<div class="gray cell">D</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="wordle-grid">
				<div class="wordle-row">
					<div class="gray cell">F</div>
					<div class="gray cell">I</div>
					<div class="gray cell">Z</div>
					<div class="gray cell">Z</div>
					<div class="gray cell">Y</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>
				Because they don't contain any of the words that we know should be in our answer. That takes us all the
				way down to 1067 words. We have a 0.094 percent chance of guessing the word correctly now.
				That's pretty good, but we can do better. We know our word has an A, but that the
				A is not in the middle position. So we remove words like
			</p>

			<div class="wordle-grid">
				<div class="wordle-row">
					<div class="gray cell">C</div>
					<div class="gray cell">L</div>
					<div class="wrong yellow cell">A</div>
					<div class="yellow cell">M</div>
					<div class="yellow cell">P</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>
				because we already know the A is not in the center. Doing this allows us to eliminate
				some extra words.
			</p>



			<p>
				So let's throw out all the words that don't have E at the end. After doing that, we only have
				814 words left. We're now at a whopping 0.12 percent chance of guessing the right word.
			</p>

			<p>
				For our last step, we know our final word will look like this:
			</p>

			<div class="wordle-grid">
				<div class="wordle-row">
					<div class="green cell">?</div>
					<div class="green cell">?</div>
					<div class="green cell">?</div>
					<div class="green cell">?</div>
					<div class="green cell">E</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>
				So we can remove all words that don't end in E. That takes us down to only 184
				words to guess from. That's a 0.5 percent chance of guessing the right answer. That's not
				easy but it's a lot better than having way too many 0's.
			</p>

			<h3>Choosing the next guess</h3>

			<p>
				So now we have 184 words to choose from. We could choose a random word, but we can do better than
				that. We want to find a word that eliminates the largest number of words possible. So we need to
				determine how much information each word would give us. But we also will penalize words that have
				the same letter twice, because that means we don't learn as much. This penalization makes sure
				we learn the most at every step.
			</p>

			<iframe src="/Figures/wordle_letter_score.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe>

			<p>
				Each letter has a score now, as you can see A and E are highest because they are
				in every word left in this list. But L and S are also very high scorers. So we can
				now take each of the remaining words and score each of them.
			</p>

			<p>
				Using these scores, the solver says the top five words are anole, alone, salve, angle, and sable,
				with scores of 539, 539, 536, 536, and 535 respectively. Now is a good time to note that while
				there are 12,947 words we can guess from, only about 2,500 are actually Wordle answers. Most of
				the chosen words are words that people actually know. So we can safely ignore anole.
				So let's chose alone.
			</p>

			<div class="wordle-grid">
				<div class="wordle-row">
					<div class="yellow cell">A</div>
					<div class="yellow cell">L</div>
					<div class="gray cell">O</div>
					<div class="gray cell">N</div>
					<div class="green cell">E</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>
				This process is repeated until we get to the end. The full result for this game
				would look like:
			</p>

			<div class="wordle-grid">
				<div class="wordle-row">
					<div class="gray cell">I</div>
					<div class="gray cell">R</div>
					<div class="yellow cell">A</div>
					<div class="gray cell">T</div>
					<div class="green cell">E</div>
				</div>
				<div class="wordle-row">
					<div class="yellow cell">A</div>
					<div class="yellow cell">L</div>
					<div class="gray cell">O</div>
					<div class="gray cell">N</div>
					<div class="green cell">E</div>
				</div>
				<div class="wordle-row">
					<div class="gray cell">S</div>
					<div class="green cell">A</div>
					<div class="yellow cell">L</div>
					<div class="gray cell">V</div>
					<div class="green cell">E</div>
				</div>
				<div class="wordle-row">
					<div class="gray cell">P</div>
					<div class="green cell">A</div>
					<div class="gray cell">G</div>
					<div class="green cell">L</div>
					<div class="green cell">E</div>
				</div>
				<div class="wordle-row">
					<div class="green cell">M</div>
					<div class="green cell">A</div>
					<div class="green cell">P</div>
					<div class="green cell">L</div>
					<div class="green cell">E</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>
				It's not a very good game, but it did solve it. So that's how a Wordle solver works!
